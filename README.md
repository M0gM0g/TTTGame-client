### Planning

Being a visually oriented person, I first created a basic game board.
This made it easier for me to grasp the game logic and how I would go about it.
Step by step I had to figure out simply how to get an X or O to display, then
how to get the values for those symbols and incorperate them into game logic.
The game logic took me quite a while but I believe it was the most rewarding part.
It forced me to stop and think about each action, where it should go and how it
should be applied to determining a winner, loser, or a draw.
The hardest part for me was understanding how the api would interact with my game.
It came down to just slowing down and thinking about WHAT the api actually needs
and HOW to get it there.

### Future Additions

In the future I would spend more time working on the HTML and CSS aspects to make
the game more visually appealling. I would also display detailed game information
to the user.
